# Python-Guessing-Game

# Overview
This program plays a “high-low” number guessing game. The secret number could be a big or small number.

# Description

The program starts by generating a random number hidden from the user that is between 0 and 100.
The user then attempts to guess the number, getting hints as to which direction (bigger or smaller, higher or lower) to go on the next guess.

# Conclusion

The game can end in one of two ways:

1. The user can correctly guess the number.
2. The user can quit playing by entering a number out of the range of 0–100.
